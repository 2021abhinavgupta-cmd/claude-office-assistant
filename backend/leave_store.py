"""Employee leave / holiday windows + overtime-to-comp-off conversion
(CLAUDE.md gotcha #119, extended by the leave management system,
2026-09-30 — see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-leave-management-design.md).

A row in `employee_leave` is an inclusive [start_date, end_date] window
with a status: 'pending' -> awaiting HR (emp009) approval, 'approved' ->
counts toward balance usage and exempts the person from the standup lock /
login nudges, 'rejected' / 'cancelled' -> inert.

Only 'approved' rows ever exempt anything or count toward balance. This is
the one deliberate behavior change from the original gotcha #119 feature:
a WhatsApp-set leave used to apply instantly, and now creates a pending
request instead, closing the self-approval loophole a real balance system
would otherwise have.

This module only imports `db` and `utils`, so it is safe to import from
routes, the scheduler, and the agent alike.
